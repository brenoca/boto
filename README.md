# Boto - Democratizing Bots

Bots and automation are extremelly useful, but unfortunately non-developers often don't have access to build their own automations
This is particularly true for DeFi and blockchain in general

Boto is a platform where non-developers can build their own logic using pre-built blocks from the marketplace and socialize their automations with others

# How it works


Users can drag and drop blocks using Boto's UI in order to build their own automations

Using Boto, someone that has a loan in AAVE could automatically check their health factor to make sure it never goes below 1 and avoid liquidation fees (5% to 10%) due to being under collateralized

If the health factor hits a specific threshold set by the user, they can automatically repay part o their loan or top up their collateral to improve their health factor

They can also add to their logic the price of gas from a Chainlink node to decide if they want to top up or repay, since each operation has a different gas cost

The combinations are endless and we are just starting!

# Block Marketplace

Boto is not only for non-developers
With Boto developers can create their on blocks, to be used by themselves and other for automation
By sharing blocks, developers can get remunerated based on the popularity of their blocks

# Socializing Bots

In addition to allowing anyone to create their own bots, by using pre-built blocks or developing their own, we want Boto to be a social platform where people share their bots with the world so other users can benefit from it and the bot creators can get remunerated
