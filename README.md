# Boto - Democratizing Bots

# Motivation

Bots and automation are extremelly useful, but unfortunately non-developers often don't have access to build their own automations. This is particularly true for DeFi and blockchain in general.

Boto is a platform where non-developers can build their own logic using pre-built blocks from the marketplace and socialize their automations with others.

# How it works


Users can drag and drop blocks using Boto's UI in order to build their own automations
